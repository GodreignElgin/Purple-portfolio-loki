# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## What I Fixed

Your portfolio app was showing a white page on GitHub Pages due to several common SPA (Single Page Application) deployment issues:

1. **Base Path Issue**: GitHub Pages serves apps from `https://username.github.io/repo-name/` but your app was configured for root `/`
2. **Router Configuration**: Used BrowserRouter which doesn't work well with GitHub Pages
3. **Missing GitHub Actions**: No automated deployment workflow

## Changes Made

### 1. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
```typescript
// Added base path for GitHub Pages
base: '/Purple-portfolio-loki/',
```

### 2. Router Update (`src/App.tsx`)
```typescript
// Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better GitHub Pages compatibility
import { HashRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
// ...
<HashRouter>
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- Runs on every push to main branch
- Builds and deploys your app automatically

### 4. Additional Files
- `.nojekyll` - Ensures GitHub Pages serves all files correctly
- Updated `package.json` with deploy script

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Go to your repository settings â†’ Pages
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will automatically deploy your app

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run build
# Then upload the dist/ folder contents to your gh-pages branch
```

## Repository Settings Required

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Your app will be available at: `https://GodreignElgin.github.io/Purple-portfolio-loki/`

## URL Structure
- Your app will be accessible at: `https://GodreignElgin.github.io/Purple-portfolio-loki/`
- Routes will use hash routing: `https://GodreignElgin.github.io/Purple-portfolio-loki/#/`

## Troubleshooting

If you still see a white page:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure the repository name matches the base path in vite.config.ts
3. Verify GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
4. Check that Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as source

Your portfolio should now work correctly on GitHub Pages! ðŸŽ‰
